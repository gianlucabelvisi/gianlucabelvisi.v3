Not that I'm proud of it, but I have spent the past 3 months thinking about Philosophy.

Whenever I find a topic difficult, tedious, or both, I feel that I need to write about it.

By the act of writing, it will become untangled in my mind. Because it has to.

That said, I like to take things a step further and write in the format of a stand-up monologue, which requires incredible precision and clearness of intent, and it's only 10x more difficult.

You don't have to, but since you're about to spend 45 minutes in the bathroom on this sunny Sunday (I know my metrics!), consider reading this new shiny blog post about Philosophy.
