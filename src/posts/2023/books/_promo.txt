Let's not make it a whole thing, but I have read 52 books in 2022.

And since I needed to brag about it and make it a whole thing, I wrote a blog post on the experience. There, you will know which were the obstacles I faced to complete the goal. You won't believe that the major one was.

Actually, I think you will believe it. It's probably not what you have in mind, but it's totally plausible. I don't know why I wrote that you won't.

Anyway, we talk a bit about books but there is also a whole section where I try to provide 3 solid reasons to read. You won't believe the second one. Why do I keep saying that?!
