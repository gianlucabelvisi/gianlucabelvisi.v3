These past days I have been sick with super high fever and pain, at times completely unable to leave the bed. And you know what? That's ok.

I also tested to see if I could finally put a checkmark under Covid, but I turned out negative. And you know what? That's ok.

Additionally, due to this whole ordeal I had to skip a pre-booked, pre-paid trip to Amsterdam. And you know what? That's ok.

Finally, during these days when I wasn't busy dying, I had the chance to watch a few movies, and they all sucked. And you know what? That's NOT ok. This is where I draw the line.

That's why I've painstakingly (like, literally) written this blog post about the 10 best films of the past year. If this is the last thing I do, it will be the last thing I do.

(I should also add that you won't believe what #3 is, that #7 will make you sick to your stomach, and other click-baity stuff.)
