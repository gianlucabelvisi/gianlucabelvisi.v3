Yes, this is a listicle. We got to that point. You won't believe the sixth one.

1. Take selfies without a selfie stick, which is universally known to be cringe

2. Scout for houses with swimming pools to use when the owners are off for vacation

3. Guide Foodora deliverers to your apartment or spot in the forest

4. Bomb your nemesis' house with eggs. Eggs sold separately

5. Bird hunting. Some modifications are required.

6. Revenge

7. Walk your dog without leaving the apartment (experimental, might be illegal and/or immoral)

8. Monitor those kids at the end of the street who seem up to no good. Are they selling dope?

9. Sell dope with plausible deniability

10. You don't need ten reasons to own a drone in 2020. One or two are more than enough. So if you've read this far, you failed the test, wtf is wrong with you?!
