It seems that society is going to fall, and we will all die soon, but on the plus side, we get to work from home for a few weeks!

I'm not sure that this is the best time to panic. Yes, life will become more complicated, alienating, and upsetting, but it doesn't have to be over-complex, irritating and absurd. We can be Westworld Season 1 without having to be Westworld Season 2!

With this in mind, I'd like to provide some pieces of advice to make your existence more bearable and your domestic seclusion less of a drag.

Content Warning: This will not contain any targeted harassment against the Germans. Even though there's a Hitler reference at some point, it is surprisingly a positive one.

## Balconies

Stop singing songs from your balconies. It was heartwarming the first time, but now it's become the new Harlem Shake.

While you're shouting out of your apartments, your neighbors are trying to work, to binge series, to conceive. We don't need to listen to you murdering Beyonce's Single Ladies.

## Zoom

While working from home, remember to always wear pants. I'll give you two reasons:

1. You will sometimes have video calls, and you will sometimes forget that you are not wearing pants. You will clumsily stand up and people will see your junk. We don't want to see your junk. We don't need to see your junk. We don't deserve your junk in our lives

2. It's important to remember that we are human, and pants are what separates us from other mammals and basic flora. Not wearing pants is a slippery slope. We start by stopping wearing pants, and we end up with a pig head on a stick outside our homes

## TODO Lists

![To do list](todo.jpg)

Sort your life out by keeping a TODO list, which is Spanish for 'everything'.

Keep it simple, though. No big plans for the future because there isn't going to be one. Once you have finally cleaned your disgusting windows, the dopamine rush that you get by closing the task will render your life meaningful for no less than three seconds.

## Entertainment

Don't even start saying that you feel bored because I will get angry. Your home is an endless source of entertainment. Look at this, this is a channel for marble races. Marble races!

## Hoarding

![Toilet paper](tpaper.jpg)

Of course, hoard as much toilet paper as you can. Those butts are not going to wipe themselves, and we are not living in civilized countries with a bidet in every household.

But for the love of Cthulhu do not forget the dishwasher suppositories! I'm down to the last three, which means that I'll have to handwash after they are gone, which means that I'd rather be dead.

## Phrasing

![Pandemic](pandemic.jpg)

Be aware that 'global pandemic' is redundant, as the pan in pandemic already infers globality. It's like saying Lochness lake, Mount Fujihama, or lazy Italians.

## Old folks

![Old people](old2.jpg)

It's perfectly fine not to like old people without wishing for them to die.

(The opposite can also be true.)

## Silver linings

![Jesus the Savior](dani1.jpg)

As Jesus said, always look at the bright side of life. There is a silver lining in all things. All of them.
What about Hitler, you'll ask. Well, he killed those silly mustaches, didn't he?

So, what's the silver lining of Coronavirus? I'd say it's not nearly as lethal as SARS, which had a 10% death rate.

So, wait, is it possible that in the future we'll have a virus that spreads as easy as Covid-19 and is as deadly as SARS? Oh yeah, absolutely!

All in all, I still think that 2020 is a better year than 2019!
